# Using the Readyset Dashboard

## Viewing the Dashboard

After creating a new Readyset instance via the installer, you can access the dashboard from your web browser by navigating to
 `http://localhost:4000`.

### Port Forwarding
If your Readyset instance is running on a remote machine, you can use port forwarding to connect to the dashboard. 
Open up a terminal and run:

```ssh -N -L 4000:localhost:4000 <user>@<remote-ip-addr>```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:4000` on your local browser.

## Interpreting the Dashboard 

### Query Overview Page
This page shows a list of proxied and cached queries and high-level performance information for both. 

- **Query ID:** the Readyset assigned identifier for proxied queries. Used to cache queries
- **Query Text:** the parameterized text for a query
- **Count:** number of times a particular query has been sent to Readyset (both proxied and cached)
- **P50 latency (ms):** the 50th percentile query latency in milliseconds
- **P90 latency (ms):** the 90th percentile query latency in milliseconds
- **P99 latency (ms):** the 99th percentile query latency in milliseconds
- **Total Duration (ms):** the sum of the execution time for all executions of the given query
- **Readyset supported:** indicates whether Readyset supports a given query

### Specific Query Page
This page deep dives into the performance information for a given query. 
- **Query Text:** interpretation of the query text
- **Query Running in Readyset:** whether the query is being cached in Readyset or proxied to the backing database
- **Query Latency:** end-to-end query latency from the time the request is received by Readyset to when a response is returned.
- **Total Query Count:** total number of queries sent to Readyset (both proxied and cached)

### Status Page
This page displays the current status of Readyset and key system health metrics. 
- **Readyset Started:** how long ago the Readyset instance was started
- **Server Request Rate:** rate of HTTP requests received by the Readyset server
- **Client Request Rate:** rate of HTTP requests received by the Readyset adapter
- **Client Connections:** number of active connections to Readyset
- **Snapshot in Progress:** whether Readyset is currently snapshotting the backing database's base tables
- **Migration in Progress:** whether Readyset is currently in the process of adding/removing a query cache
