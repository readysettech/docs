# Background 
When dealing with large datasets, complicated queries, or high request volumes, off-the-shelf databases often run into performance 
problems that are challenging to overcome. It's therefore rare to rely on relational databases alone to meet performance SLAsâ€“ 
instead, you have to denormalize data or build infrastructure around read replicas and custom query caching layers on top of Redis 
or Memcached. These approaches take significant engineering overhead to implement and introduce operational complexity, thus 
increasing the risk of failures and outages.

# Readyset 

Readyset is a distributed SQL cache that automatically keeps query results fresh based on changes to your primary database.

### Automatic Cache Maintenance
Under the hood, Readyset precomputes and caches the results of prepared statements (i.e., parameterized SQL queries). Readyset 
connects to your primary database and receives a replication stream of data updates. Using these updates, Readyset **incrementally 
updates** its own cache state to reflect the data changes. 

### Wire-Compatible with MySQL and Postgres
Readyset is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres so it can be integrated slotted between your existing MySQL or Postgres database
without any code changes.
