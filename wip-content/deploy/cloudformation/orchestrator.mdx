# CloudFormation Deployment via the Readyset Orchestrator
You can configure and deploy a Readyset cluster to a specified AWS account using the Readyset orchestrator. The orchestrator 
automatically checks that all of the prerequisites are met for each step in the deployment process. If a prerequisite is not met, 
the orchestrator requests to make the change on your behalf.

If you are interested in trying out Readyset, but not yet using it in a production environment, we recommend using the Readyset orchestrator to set up your cluster.
