# Release Notes

The following are known issues with Readyset.Cloud.

- Readyset.Cloud does not automatically delete replication slots on the backend Postgres database.
  When Readyset establishes a connection with the backend datbase, it uses
  [logical replication](https://blog.readyset.io/how-database-replication-works-under-the-hood/) to replicate the database.
  When deleting an instance of the Readyset cache, Readyset.Cloud does not vacate these replication slots.
  Users are advised to remove replication slots manually like so:

  List all replication slots:

  ```
  SELECT slot_name FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name ~* 'readyset.*';
  ```

  Sample output is as shown:

  ```
  slot_name
  ═══════════════════════════════
  readyset_vol094d259d1f1a03ef3
  readyset_vol0afe19b3bca8a55f3
  (2 rows)
  ```

  Drop each replication slot, as shown in this example below:

```
 SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('readyset_vol094d259d1f1a03ef3');
 SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('readyset_vol0afe19b3bca8a55f3');

```
