# VPC Peering

## How to accept Readyset VPC peering request

Go to **VPC** > **Peering connections**. You should see one peering connection as **Pending**. Select the pending peering connection and click **Actions** > **Accept request**:

A new pop-up window appears, showing all the details. Take a note of the **Requester CIDRs** and **Peering connection ID** click Accept request:

Now we will need to add the Requester CIDRs block to all routing tables assigned to your VPC. Navigate to the Routing tables ( **VPC** > **Routing tables** ) and filter all routing tables for your VPC:

![VPC Peering Filter VPC](./img/vpc_peering_filter_vpc.jpg)

Enter each one of your routing tables by clicking the routing table ID:

In the Route Table detailed view, select **Edit routes**:

![VPC Peering Edit Route](./img/vpc_peering_edit_route.jpg)

Add the VPC Peering CIDRs block noted before in the **Destination** field, set the target to **Peering Connection**, select the respective **peering connection ID** noted when accepting VPC peering request and click **Save changes**:

Repeat this process for all routing tables on this VPC.
