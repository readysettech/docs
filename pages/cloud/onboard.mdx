# Onboarding to ReadySet.Cloud

This section walks through the process of onboarding to [Readyset.Cloud](https://readyset.cloud).

## Create an account

Follow the prompts to create a login account and log in to Readyset.Cloud.

## Create a project

A Project is a logical collection of Readyset instances. Follow the prompts to create an empty project.

## Create a cache instance

Now proceed to create a Readyset cache instance under the project just created.
One would typically deploy a Readyset cache instance between the client and the
backend Postgres database. When creating a cache, you must provide connectivity
details so the Readyset instance can connect to your backend database.

### Prerequisites

- Please follow the instructions to configure [AWS
  RDS](/reference/configure-your-database/postgres/aws-rds-directions) or [AWS
  Aurora](/reference/configure-your-database/postgres/aws-aurora-directions)
  Databases.

  <Callout type="warning"> Do not skip the above step as AWS RDS must be configured with replication and
  appropriate privileges allowing Readyset to subscribe to changes from the
  backend database. </Callout>

- You are encouraged to test connectivity to your public RDS or Aurora Postgres
  database by connecting to the URL from a Postgres client.
  For, e.g.

  ```
  psql postgresql://postgres:password@pghostname.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
  ```

### Instance creation

Here are some general guidelines for creating the cache instance.

- When choosing a region, pick one identical to your backend database.
- Cache creation will take several minutes. If the cluster creation fails, the
  most common reason is the inability to connect to the backend Postgres
  database. If so, re-validate the Postgres URL, credentials, port number, and
  database configuration for connectivity, including enabling permissions.

### Gather information

Readyset `check_db_postgres` is a script to gather information required to create a cache instance:

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readysettech/readyset/main/quickstart/check_db_postgres.sh | bash -s -- postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name
```
Replace the `postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name` part with your credentials to access the Postgres instance you will be connecting to Readyset.
If your instance is not public accessible you will require to have `aws cli` configured in order to fetch the VPC information.

Example output:

```bash
Readyset Create New Cache Fields:
Use below information to fill up your new Readyset Cloud Cache Instance:
{
  "cache_type":  Free,
  "user": postgres,
  "host": postgres.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com,
  "port": 5432,
  "db_name": postgres,
  "connection_type": "private",
  "upstream_aws_account_id": 09999999999,
  "upstream_vpc_region": us-east-1,
  "upstream_vpc_id": vpc-ffffffff,
  "upstream_vpc_cidr_block": 172.31.0.0/16,
  "desired_cluster_cidr_block": 10.0.0.0/16,
}
