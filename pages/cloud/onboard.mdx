# Onboarding to ReadySet.Cloud

This section walks through the process of onboarding to [Readyset.Cloud](https://readyset.cloud).

## Create an account

Follow the prompts to create a login account and log in to Readyset.Cloud.

## Create a project

A Project is a logical collection of Readyset instances. Follow the prompts to create an empty project.

## Create a cache instance

Now proceed to create a Readyset cache instance under the project just created.
One would typically deploy a Readyset cache instance between the client and the
backend Postgres database. When creating a cache, you must provide connectivity
details so the Readyset instance can connect to your backend database.

### Prerequisites

- Please follow the instructions to configure [AWS
  RDS](/reference/configure-your-database/postgres/aws-rds-directions) or [AWS
  Aurora](/reference/configure-your-database/postgres/aws-aurora-directions)
  Databases.

- When connecting using a public RDS URL, you must format the URL like so:

  ```
  postgresql://<username>:<password>@<pghost>:5432/<pgdb>
  ```

  Note: You must explicitly specify the port number in the URL.

  You are encouraged to test connectivity to your public RDS or Aurora Postgres
  database by connecting to the URL from a Postgres client.
  For, e.g.

  ```
  psql postgresql://postgres:password@pghostname.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
  ```

### Instance creation

Here are some general guidelines for creating the cache instance.

- When choosing a region, pick one identical to your backend database.
- Cache creation will take several minutes. If the cluster creation fails, the
  most common reason is the inability to connect to the backend Postgres
  database. If so, re-validate the Postgres URL, credentials, port number, and
  database configuration for connectivity, including enabling permissions.
