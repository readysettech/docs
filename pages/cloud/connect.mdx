# Connect to Readyset.Cloud

Since Readyset.Cloud is a cloud-managed version of the open source software, the
instructions are identical to connecting to a self-hosted version of Readyset.

The URL for the Readyset instance resembles that of a Postgres instance and is
conveniently accessible from the Readyset.Cloud Overview page.
