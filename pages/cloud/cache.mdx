# Cache queries

This section describes how to cache queries on [Readyset.Cloud](https://readyset.cloud)

1. As in the case of the [self-hosted readyset](/get-started/cache), we first send
   query traffic through the Readyset instance. By default, all queries sent through
   Readyset are transparently proxied to the backend database.

2. Click the "Cache query" button to list all proxied queries. Find the
   queries you would like to optimize and cache them.

3. Now re-run the traffic and experience low latency query execution.
