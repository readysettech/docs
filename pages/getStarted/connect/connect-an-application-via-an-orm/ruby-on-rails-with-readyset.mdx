# Using ReadySet with Ruby on Rails

Enabling ReadySet to work with a Rails application requires Rails multiple database support, which is easy to configure. 
In short, ReadySet becomes a lighting fast read-replica. 

## Setting up ReadySet
ReadySet can speed up Rails read queries quite easily. Setting up your application to take advantage of ReadySet takes a few steps. 
First, connect ReadySet to your database. For instance, if [running with Docker](/deploy/deploy-with-docker) and connecting to Postgres, update the 
`UPSTREAM_DB_URL` variable in ReadySet’s `compose.yml` to point to your Postgres instance. For instance, use the standard Postgres connection 
string in the format `postgresql://user:password@hostl:5432/database_name`. 

Next, take note of the `LISTEN_ADDRESS` for your 
ReadySet instance - normally this is set to `0.0.0.0:5433`. This will be important because this will become the address of the read replica you'll 
add to your Rails application. 

To ensure [ReadySet is properly configured](/cache/check-snapshotting) and pointing to your target database, simply use the Postgres client, `psql` and connect to ReadySet as 
you would a normal Postgres instance. You can do so by using the normal Postgres connection string and substitute in the port ReadySet is listening on (i.e. 5433). 

```sh
psql postgresql://user:password@host:5433/database_name
```

Once you’re in the Postgres console, type `show readyset status;` and look for Snapshot Status to be Completed. 

## Configuring Rails in 3 steps

[Ruby On Rails allows you to configure ReadySet](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#activating-automatic-role-switching) as a read replica and define a time window after writes 
for when to switch read traffic over to ReadySet. This allows clients to observe recent writes if there is write 
traffic ongoing while still taking advantage of ReadySet's caching for read-heavy workloads.

This will take 3 steps. You’ll need to add ReadySet as a read replica and configure ActiveRecord to 
route traffic and finally configure Rails' connection switching middleware with a few quick changes.

### Update database configuration

Taking advantage of ReadySet means defining a read replica of your primary database. 
Rails makes this incredibly simple and in the case of ReadySet you’ll configure the replica to point 
to your ReadySet instance. We recommend following Rails established patterns and name your primary 
database as `primary` and then your read replica ReadySet instance as `primary_replica`. 

For instance, your `database.yml` file will look something like this: 

```yml
production:
  primary:
    database: my_primary_database
    username: root
    password: <%= ENV['ROOT_PASSWORD'] %>
    adapter: postgresql
  primary_replica:
    database: my_primary_database
    username: root
    password: <%= ENV['READYSET_PASSWORD'] %>
    adapter: postgresql
    replica: true 
    database_tasks: false
```

It’s important to note that the `primary_replica` definition points to ReadySet and that two 
flags are set: `replica` is `true` and `database_tasks` is `false`. The `database_tasks` flag 
will disable Rails database migrations running against ReadySet. This isn’t needed as 
ReadySet will see any changes to the primary database already. 

### Update `ApplicationRecord` to use two connections

In your application's `app/models` directory, you’ll find a base class for all of your model classes 
often called `ApplicationRecord`. Open up that class and add the following line: 

```ruby
connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary_replica }
```

If you haven’t made any changes to this base class, it should look like this:

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class 

  connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary_replica }
end
```

Note how `connects_to_database` is pointing to the names of both the primary database and ReadySet 
via the names you defined in your `database.yml` configuration. 

If you aren't on Rails 7, you'll need to replace `primary_abstract_class` with `self.abstract_class = true`. 
What's more, if for some reason you do not have access to an `ApplicationRecord` base class, you'll need to
[monkey patch](https://dev.to/ayushn21/applying-monkey-patches-in-rails-1bj1) one. 

### Activate connection switching middleware

Finally, you’ll need to activate Rails middleware that’ll ensure writes go to the primary database and 
reads through ReadySet. First run this command to generate a configuration file: 

```sh
bin/rails generate active_record:multi_db
```

This command will create a new file: `config/initializers/multi_db.rb`. Open up that file and uncomment 
the following lines:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
  config.active_record.database_resolver = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver
  config.active_record.database_resolver_context = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver::Session
end
```

It’s important to note that a delay of 2 seconds is designed to ensure the read replica (in this case ReadySet) 
is consistent with writes that are going directly to the primary database. 

## You’re off to the races! 

At this point, if you start your Rails application, read requests will go directly to ReadySet and 
writes will go to your primary Postgres database. You’ll next need to [configure which SQL select statements (i.e. reads) you’ll 
want to cache](/cache/creating-a-cache).
