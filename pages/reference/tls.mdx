# TLS Support

Readyset supports TLS encryption between itself and your upstream database out
of the box. To do this, Readyset must have access to the root certificate used
by your upstream database. Operating systems typically come with the root
certificates for some common certificate authorities already installed. If your
upstream database uses a different root certificate, then you must either
install that certificate (such that all applications on your system can use it
to verify certificates) or provide the root certificate file path directly to
Readyset via the `--ssl-root-cert` option.

<Callout type="warning">
The `--ssl-root-cert` option only supports a single certificate in the PEM or
DER format. It does not support bundles containing multiple certificates.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
On macOS, providing the root certificate via the `--ssl-root-cert` option is
not supported, the Apple Security framework (used by Readyset to provide TLS
support) does not allow the use of untrusted certificates even when explicitly
provided.
</Callout>

Below are instructions for installing and trusting a new root certificate on supported platforms:

<Tabs items={['Ubuntu', 'Amazon Linux 2', 'macOS']}>

<Tab>
Readyset uses the system-provided OpenSSL package on Linux.

The following instructions are derived from [the Ubuntu docs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-trust-store).

To install a new certificate, first download the certificate, then run the following:
```sh
# Change the extension to .crt, and if necessary, convert from DER to PEM format
# Place the output file in the appropriate system directory
sudo openssl x509 -outform pem -in $INFILE -out /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/$OUTFILE.crt

# Install the certificate
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

Readyset uses the system-provided OpenSSL package on Linux.

The following instructions are derived from [the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html).

To install a new certificate, download the certificate, place it in `/etc/pki/tls/certs`,
and set the file ownership and permissions as follows:
```sh
sudo chown root:root $CERTIFICATE
sudo chmod 600 $CERTIFICATE
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
Readyset uses the Security framework on macOS.
Certificates must be trusted by the system to be used.

To install and trust a new certificate, do the following:

1. Download the certificate you wish to install
1. Open the Keychain Access application
1. From the left-side menu, under System Keychains, select System
1. Drag and drop the certificate into the keychain (or File > Import items...)
1. Open the newly installed certificate (or File > Get Info)
1. Set Trust > Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to Always Trust and close the window (it prompts for authorization)

Below are download links for the root certificates for supported cloud database providers:

<Tabs items={['Amazon RDS', 'Azure Database', 'Google Cloud SQL']}>

<Tab>
The [Amazon RDS global certificate bundle](https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem)
includes root certificates for every AWS region.

Alternatively, only download the [region-specific bundle(s)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificates)
you need.
</Tab>

<Tab>
The certificates used by Azure Database are probably already installed on your system.

Both [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/single-server/concepts-ssl-connection-security)
and [Azure Database for MySQL Single Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/single-server/concepts-ssl-connection-security)
require the [DigiCert Global Root G2](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootG2.crt.pem)
certificate.

Both [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl)
and [Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl)
require the [DigiCert Global Root CA](https://dl.cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem)
certificate.

<Tab>
Google Cloud SQL creates a new root certificate per server instance. Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance#server-certs)
to locate and download the certificate for your particular instance.
