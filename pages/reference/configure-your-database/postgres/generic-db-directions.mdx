# General PostgreSQL

If you are not using AWS RDS or Aurora Postgres, use these general instructions to configure your Postgres database. 

## Instructions

To ensure you have the correct permissions set, run the following commands as the database user you will use Readyset with:

#### 1. Ensure Postgres version 13.0 or higher is running.

```sql
testdb=> SELECT version();
      version
-----------------------
 PostgreSQL 14.8
(1 row)

```

#### 2. Ensure that logical replication is enabled.

```sql
testdb=> SHOW WAL_LEVEL;
 wal_level
-----------
 logical
(1 row)
```

`LOGICAL` is required to ensure sufficient data is present in the replication stream.

#### 3. Ensure superuser permissions are enabled.

Readyset uses superuser access to be notified of changes to table DDL.

```sql
testdb=> SELECT * FROM pg_user where usename = CURRENT_USER;
 usename  | usesysid | usecreatedb | usesuper | userepl | usebypassrls |  passwd  | valuntil | useconfig
----------+----------+-------------+----------+---------+--------------+----------+----------+-----------
 postgres |       10 | t           | t        | t       | t            | ******** |          |
(1 row)
```

Ensure the `usesuper` variable is `true`.

#### 4. Decide on how to deal with unsupported features.

Some Postgres features, like row-level security, are not yet supported by Readyset. You can either skip replicating those tables
into Readyset (in [Step 2 – Install Readyset](/get-started/install-rs)), or alternatively,
 you can disable these features on tables replicated by Readyset prior to proceeding.
