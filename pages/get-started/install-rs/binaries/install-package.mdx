# Install Readyset System Packages

Readyset can be installed as a stand-alone `systemd` service using a Linux
distribution package.  We currently produce the following x86_64/amd64 packages:
* `deb` for Debian-based systems running OpenSSL 3 (i.e. Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12).
* `rpm` for Fedora Core 39 (and compatible distros).
* `rpm` for Amazon Linux 2023.

To install the package:
1. [Download the `deb` or `rpm` package from `Assets` on our GitHub release page](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/releases/latest).
2. Install `deb` packages using `sudo dpkg -i <PACKAGE_NAME>`.
3. Install `rpm` packages using `sudo rpm -ivh <PACKAGE_NAME>`.


## Configure Readyset Service

The Readyset service must be configured to connect to an upstream database
before it can be started. Edit the default `/etc/readyset/readyset.conf` file
installed by the package and update the `UPSTREAM_DB_URL` to point to the
database.  Additional configuration variables are documented in `readyset.conf`
as well as on [the CLI `options` page](/reference/cli/readyset#options).


## Prepare the Database

For directions on how to check and alter these configurations, please see our
[database reference documentation](/reference/configure-your-database). The
steps to configure these settings vary by database type and hosting provider.


## Run Readyset Service

Once `readyset.conf` has been updated, the service can be controlled with
[`systemctl`](https://www.linux.org/docs/man1/systemctl.html).  For example,
use:
* `sudo systemctl start readyset` to start the service
* `sudo systemctl stop readyset` to stop the service

The default `readyset.conf` file configures service logging to go to the
`/var/lib/readyset` directory, but that can be changed using the `LOG_PATH`
setting.  If logging to `journalctl` is desired instead, comment out `LOG_PATH`
in `readyset.conf`.


## Uninstalling Readyset Service

**For Ubuntu/Debian:** To uninstall, use `sudo apt remove readyset`.  This will
uninstall the service and executable, but will leave the
`/etc/readyset/readyset.conf` configuration file.  To remove all `readyset`
files entirely, use `sudo apt purge readyset`.

**For Fedora, Amazon Linux, or rpm-based distros:** To uninstall, use `sudo rpm
--erase readyset`.  This will uninstall the service and executable.  The
`/etc/readyset/readyset.conf` configuration file will be preserved.  To remove
all readyset files, delete the `/var/lib/readyset` and `/etc/readyset`
directories.
