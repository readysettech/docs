# Connect to Readyset

Readyset sits between your application and your database. When you start Readyset, it'll connect 
to your database and snapshot it. You'll need to configure your application to connect to Readyset 
so that Readyset can see the various SQL queries your application uses. By default, all queries 
are proxied to your database. 

In order to make use of Readyset, you'll need to configure it to cache specific queries.

You can connect to Readyset directly using your database's shell, such as `psql`. From there, you can 
see any queries that Readyset has seen and which ones are cacheable.
