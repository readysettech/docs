# Use Readyset with Ruby on Rails

This guide walks you through how to use Readyset with your Ruby on Rails app. 
To do this, you'll use the [built-in Rails multiple database support](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#activating-automatic-role-switching) to get the performance of 
caching with the simplicity of a single read replica. 

## 0. Set up Readyset
First, you'll set up Readyset using Docker.
  1. [Make sure your database is configured for Readyset](/reference/configure-your-database)
  2. [Install Readyset](/get-started/install-rs)

## 1. Configure Rails in three steps

Ruby On Rails allows you to configure Readyset as a read replica and define a time window after writes 
for when to switch read traffic over to Readyset. This allows clients to observe recent writes if there is write 
traffic ongoing while still taking advantage of Readyset's caching for read-heavy workloads.

This will take three steps. You'll need to add Readyset as a read replica, then configure ActiveRecord to 
route traffic, and finally configure Rails' connection switching middleware with a few quick changes.

### a. Update database configuration

Taking advantage of Readyset means defining a read replica of your primary database. 
Rails makes this incredibly simple and in the case of Readyset, <b>you'll configure the replica to point 
to your Readyset instance</b>. We recommend following Rails established patterns and name your primary 
database as `primary` and then your read replica Readyset instance as `primary_replica`. 

For instance, your `database.yml` file will look something like this: 

```yml
production:
  primary:
    database: my_primary_database
    username: root
    password: <%= ENV['ROOT_PASSWORD'] %>
    adapter: postgresql
  primary_replica:
    database: my_primary_database
    username: root
    password: <%= ENV['READYSET_PASSWORD'] %>
    host: <%= ENV['READYSET_HOST'] %>
    port: 5433
    adapter: postgresql
    replica: true 
    database_tasks: false
```

It's important to note that the `primary_replica` definition points to Readyset and that two 
flags are set: `replica` is `true` and `database_tasks` is `false`. The `database_tasks` flag 
will disable Rails database migrations running against Readyset. This isn't needed as 
Readyset will see any changes to the primary database already. 

### b. Update `ApplicationRecord` to use two connections

In your application's `app/models` directory, you'll find a base class for all of your model classes 
often called `ApplicationRecord`. Open up that class and add the following line: 

```ruby copy 
connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary_replica }
```

If you haven't made any changes to this base class, it should look like this:

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class 

  connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary_replica }
end
```

Note how `connects_to database:` is pointing to the names of both the primary database and Readyset
via the names you defined in your `database.yml` configuration. 

If you aren't on Rails 7, you'll need to replace `primary_abstract_class` with `self.abstract_class = true`. 
What's more, if for some reason you do not have access to an `ApplicationRecord` base class, you'll need to
[monkey patch](https://dev.to/ayushn21/applying-monkey-patches-in-rails-1bj1) one. 

### c. Activate connection switching middleware

Finally, you'll need to activate Rails middleware that'll ensure writes go to the primary database and 
reads through Readyset. First run this command to generate a configuration file: 

```sh copy 
bin/rails generate active_record:multi_db
```

This command will create a new file: `config/initializers/multi_db.rb`. Open up that file and uncomment 
the following lines:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
  config.active_record.database_resolver = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver
  config.active_record.database_resolver_context = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver::Session
end
```

It's important to note that a delay of 2 seconds is designed to ensure the read replica (in this case Readyset) 
is consistent with writes that are going directly to the primary database. 

## You're off to the races! 

At this point, if you start your Rails application, read requests will go directly to Readyset and 
writes will go to your primary Postgres database. You'll next need to configure which SQL select statements (i.e. reads) youâ€™ll 
want to cache. Check out [our caching guide](/get-started/cache#0-creating-a-cache) for more information.
